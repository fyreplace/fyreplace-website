  <h1>Fyreplace terms of service</h1>
  <h2 id="user-content">User generated content</h2>
  <p>
    Content submitted to Fyreplace is owned solely by the holder of the account uploading it.
    Responsibility for uploaded content falls onto said account holder. Fyreplace
    developers/moderators may not be held responsible for the content published on the platform.
  </p>
  <h2 id="content-allowed">Content allowed on the platform</h2>
  <p>
    By creating an account, you agree to abide by the following rules and guidelines at all times
    when using the platform. The following types of content are forbidden on the platform:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Illegal content</strong>
      <br />
      As data is stored in Germany, allowed content is bounded by German law.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Irrespectful content</strong>
      <br />
      No amount of bullying, harrassement, discrimination based on ethnicity, personal beliefs/opinions,
      gender, sexual orientation, is allowed. This list is not meant to be exhaustive. In simple terms:
      be nice to each other.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Violent, graphic imagery</strong>
      <br />
      An exception may apply to ongoing, current events.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Explicit sexual content</strong>
      <br />
      Better suited alternatives exist and shall be preferred for browsing and sharing this type of content.
    </li>
  </ul>
  This list is not meant to be exhaustive. What behavior is considered okay and what is not is left at
  the discretion of the moderators. While it is understandable that a precise, complete list is easier
  to follow, a general direction should be enough; and lists can never account for more nuanced or subjective
  matters.
  <br />
  If you are currently reading this document because you are unsure of what you can post or not, you
  can always <a href="/contact">get in touch</a>!
  <h2 id="moderation">Bans and account termination</h2>
  Failure to comply to the rules may result in a temporary or full ban, depending on the severity of
  the offense. Fyreplace is meant to be a welcoming place where everyone can feel at ease.
  <br />
  If you believe you have been victim of an abusive ban decision,
