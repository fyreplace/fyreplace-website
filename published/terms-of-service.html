      <h1>Fyreplace terms of service</h1>
      <h2 id="user-content">User generated content</h2>
      <p>
        Content submitted to Fyreplace is owned solely by the holder of the
        account uploading it. Responsibility for uploaded content falls onto
        said account holder. Fyreplace developers/moderators may not be held
        responsible for the content published on the platform.
      </p>
      <h2 id="content-allowed">Content allowed on the platform</h2>
      <p>
        By creating an account, you agree to abide by the following rules and
        guidelines at all times when using the platform. The following types of
        content are forbidden on the platform:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Illegal content</strong>
          <br />
          As data is stored in Germany, allowed content is bounded by German
          law.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Irrespectful content</strong>
          <br />
          No amount of bullying, harrassement, discrimination based on
          ethnicity, personal beliefs/opinions, gender, sexual orientation, is
          allowed. This list is not meant to be exhaustive. In simple terms: be
          nice to each other.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Violent, graphic imagery</strong>
          <br />
          An exception may apply to ongoing, current events.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Explicit sexual content</strong>
          <br />
          Better suited alternatives exist and shall be preferred for browsing
          and sharing this type of content.
        </li>
      </ul>
      This list is not meant to be exhaustive. What behavior is considered okay
      and what is not is left at the discretion of the moderators. While it is
      understandable that a precise, complete list is easier to follow, a
      general direction should be enough; and lists can never account for more
      nuanced or subjective matters.

      you can post or not, you can always <a href="/contact">get in touch</a>!
      <h2 id="moderation">Bans and account termination</h2>
      Failure to comply to the rules may result in a temporary or full ban,
      depending on the severity of the offense. Fyreplace is meant to be a
      welcoming place where everyone can feel at ease.
      <br />
      If you believe you have been victim of an abusive ban decision,
      <a href="/contact">please get in contact</a>.
